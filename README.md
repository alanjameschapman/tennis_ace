# Tennis Ace: Predicting Player Winnings

The notebook `tennis_ace.ipynb` contains the code and methodology for predicting tennis player winnings using linear regression models.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the winnings of tennis players based on various features such as aces, double faults, first serve percentage, and other performance metrics. By using linear regression models, we aim to identify the key factors that influence player earnings and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

## Models

### Single-Feature Model
In the single-feature model, we use one feature at a time to predict player winnings. This helps in understanding the individual impact of each feature.

### Two-Feature Model
The two-feature model uses a combination of two features to predict player winnings. This allows us to explore the interaction between different features.

### Multi-Feature Model
The multi-feature model incorporates multiple features to predict player winnings. This comprehensive approach aims to capture the combined effect of various factors on player earnings.

## Results
The results section presents the performance of each model, comparing their accuracy and identifying the most significant predictors of player winnings.

## Conclusion
The conclusion summarizes the findings of the analysis, highlighting the key features that influence player earnings and the effectiveness of different linear regression models.
